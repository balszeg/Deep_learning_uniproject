# COVID-19 detection on lung X-ray and CT images using Deep Convolutional Networks

This project created as the semester homework for Deep Learning in Practice with Python and LUA (VITMAV45) course at 2020/21/1 period.

Team name: GreatPeakyKoders

The chosen task is to train and evaulate a convolutional neural network for COVID-19 detection on lung X-ray and images.

The used datasets are the CovidX four subsets: 
-[Covid chestxray](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset) <br/>
-[Actualmed COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset Initiative](https://github.com/agchung/Actualmed-COVID-chestxray-dataset) <br/>
-[Figure 1 COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset Initiative](https://github.com/agchung/Figure1-COVID-chestxray-dataset) <br/>
-[Covid19 radiography database on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) <br/>

These images were collected from different hospitals during the 2019-20 Corona virus pandemic. They are not always shows just this specific disease, there several other types too.
